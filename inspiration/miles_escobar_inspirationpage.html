          <p class="ken1-p">Ken Carson is a rapper from Atlanta, Georgia. Ken Breaks the norms when it comes to
               identification in music genre and groups. What makes his music unique is how energetic and fun it is to 
               listen to. His music is a blend of electronic, rap and rage music. What draws me to his music is how he
               blends the high energy of metal and the flows and rythm of rap, as well as the dark theme he carries himself
               in.

          <p class="ken2-p">The beats and production in his music can range from soft and melodic to chaotic and loud.
               A few songs that fit this narrative are
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_y1aG9hnH8" class="song-link"> Me and My Kup</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5dGqZHSql8" class="song-link"> It's Over</a>,
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jao-W5tJkYo" class="song-link"> Freestyle 2</a>, and
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf0B0yj7Kas" class="song-link"> Overseas</a>.
               
                The promotional material he used for his latest album <i>A Great Chaos</i> was inspired from the gore/shock website Liveleak,
               which I found unique because I have never seen any musical artist use that type of aesthetic to promote their 
               music. I aspire to use Ken's method of blending diffrent styles to create my own unique product.</border>

        <h2><em><a href="https://ghiblicollection.com/" class="ken-link"> Hayao Miyazaki</a></em></h2>

               <p class="hayao-p"> Hayo Miyazaki, a Japanese animator and founder of Ghibili Studios, is my second inspiration.
                    What inspires me about Miyazaki is his story telling in the films he creates. One movie in particular is 
                    <i>The Boy and the Heron</i>. These films at first glance is shown to be cute movie with breath taking visuals. 
                    But when diving deep in the plot and themes, can convey thought provoking messages and metaphors. Miyazaki inspires
                    me to do the same with my work, to have layers of content that viewers can comprehend, making my work not as one
                    dimensional. As well as he himself is an inpirational person, with his message to constantly push forward regardless
                    of what you've gone through and what is ahead of you.

               <p class="hayao-p"> Riot Games, a videogame publisher and development studio based in California, is a compnay I dream to 
                    work for. Riot Games is known for games such as League of Legends, Valorant and Teamfight Tactics. What I like about 
                    these games is how simple they are to play. The mechanics are easy to understand, alongside an in depth tutorial that
                    teaches you everything you need to know to get started with the game. But with simple gameplay, comes a very high skill
                    ceiling. As an aspiring video game developer, I aim to create games where it is easy to pick up, but hard to master.
