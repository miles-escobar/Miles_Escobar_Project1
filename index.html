          <p class="placeholder"> I am a 20 year old Filipino American majoring in graphic design in San Francsico State University,
            I love sports and I have an extensive history in sports, I played tennis competitively for 12 years, 
            I have dipped my toes in strength and combat sports such as powerlifting and wrestling, and as of now 
            I am trying out boxing. A few hobbies of mine are listening to music, and pc building. I built my pc
            this past summer and I am very proud of my end product, the pc components are a AMD ryzen 5 7600x,
            rtx 4060 gpu, 32 gigabytes of T-Force ddr5 ram, 2 terabyte n.2 nvme, and a lian li 360 millimeter
            all in one cooler alongside lian li strimmer lights. In terms of music I mostly listen to Ken Carson,
            Beabadoobee, Slipknot and Wisp. The girl to the right of me is my girlfriend of 5 years, her name is Liz
            and she is sweetest and most caring woman I have ever met, I am very lucky to have someone like that be part 
            of my life and helps give me the motivation to be a better person every day. The reason why I am majoring in
            graphic design is because I played lots of video games growing up, and after taking a video game development
            summer class for unreal engine, I knew that becoming a video game developer was my future career.
